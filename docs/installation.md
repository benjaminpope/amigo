# Installation

Amigo should be installed from source. Clone the repository and install the package with pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/amigo.git
cd amigo
pip install .
```

It has been developed and locally tested in Python 3.11 on both CPU and GPU, although it is expected to work on newer versions too.

Amigo also requires a set of calibration files, which will be available publicly soon. In the meantime, please contact me directly to obtain them.
